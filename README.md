# Titanic Survival Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using a Logistic Regression model. The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and leverages various libraries for data processing and model building.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, passenger class, and more. This is a binary classification problem where the target variable is `Survived`.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic passenger data, which includes various details about the passengers such as age, sex, class, and whether they survived. The dataset is expected to be in CSV format with a filename `titanic_data.csv`.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you need the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
